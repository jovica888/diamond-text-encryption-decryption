<H1>Diamond Text Encryption Decryption</H1>

<p>The code, titled <strong>"Diamond Text Encryption Decryption"</strong>, is a powerful, unbreakable encryption solution, resembling the resilience and strength of a diamond. It allows secure encryption and decryption of messages up to 1,000 characters, leveraging an innovative positional encoding mechanism based on a private key and advanced SHA-256 hashing. This design makes it exceptionally hard to break, as each message is securely interleaved within an array of randomized positions, making it as unbreakable as a diamond.</p>
<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Key-Based Positional Encoding</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>generatePositions</code> function creates a unique sequence of positions by hashing the private key using SHA-256. This hash provides consistent, unique positions within a total array length of 10,000. The private key, which must be between 20 and 250 characters, is hashed and divided into segments, each contributing a 16-bit positional value. The code continues to hash and re-hash (using hash chaining) until it generates enough unique positions to encode the entire message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unbreakable Structure Like Diamond</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By positioning each character of the encoded message in a randomized sequence within a large array, and filling remaining spaces with random characters, this encryption method creates an unbreakable, complex structure. Just as diamond's molecular bonds make it unbreakable, this encrypted format ensures that even if a part of the encrypted array is visible, it is almost impossible to deduce the original message or its correct sequence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encoding and Randomized Character Fills</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After encoding the message into a base64 format, it appends a unique end marker <code>{*[END]*}</code> to signify the message's endpoint. Each character is placed in a designated position, and the remaining positions are filled with random alphanumeric and special characters. This randomized filling further reinforces the "diamond-like" unbreakability by masking the true message within an array of distracting characters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decoding Mechanism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When decrypting, the code uses the same positional sequence generated from the key to reconstruct the original message. The retrieval process stops upon encountering the <code>{*[END]*}</code> marker, which signifies the end of the encrypted message. This ensures precise and accurate decryption, mirroring the unbreakable consistency of a diamond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compatibility and Security</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is designed to operate within HTML forms, allowing easy encryption and decryption for messages of up to 1,000 characters. This unique approach to character encoding and positioning makes the encryption mechanism virtually unbreakable for unauthorized users who do not possess the exact key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With its diamond-like durability, <strong>Diamond Text Encryption Decryption</strong> offers a formidable solution for private, secure message encryption, ensuring that confidential information remains protected within an unbreakable structure.</p>
